# Automation scripts with Lux - LUcid eXpect

Lux scripts for a REST API test

#### How to run:
 1. Install Lux environment from repo: https://github.com/hawk/lux

I had no luck setting this up in Windows/cygwin, but worked for me on a CentOS7

 2. Clone this repository and run tests with `lux lux/apitest`
